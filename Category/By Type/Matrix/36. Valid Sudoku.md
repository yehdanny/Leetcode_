# Leetcode  36. Valid Sudoku

## 分類 : Matix Medium

## 題目：
Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

Example 1:

Input: board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.

## 演算法：
- 產生3*3內的值
  - temp = [board[x][y] for x in range(r, r + 3) for y in range(c, c + 3)] 

## 程式碼：
```python
class Solution(object):
    def isValidSudoku(self, board):
        n = len(board)
        for i in range(n):#every-row
            if self.helper(board[i])==False:
                return False
        for j in range(n):#every-col
            temp=[]
            for i in range(n):
                temp.append(board[i][j])
            if self.helper(temp)==False:
                return False
        for r in range(0,9,3):#check-box
            for c in range(0,9,3):
                '''
                temp=[]
                for i in range(r,r+3):
                    for j in range(c,c+3):
                        temp.append(board[i][j])
                '''
                temp = [board[x][y] for x in range(r, r + 3) for y in range(c, c + 3)] 
                if self.helper(temp)==False:
                    return False
        return True

    def helper(self, array):
        #arrary=[1~9]
        n =len(array)
        d={}
        for c in array:
            #print(c)
            if c !="." and c not in d:
                d[c]=1
            elif c in d:
                return False
        return True
```
## Time Complexity & Space complexity:
- Time Complexity   :   Big-O(__1__)
- Space Complexity   :  Big-O(__1__)

## 補充：
### Time Complexity :
- ( O(1) ) — the board is always 9×9
### Space complexity :
- ( O(1) ) — the board is always 9×9
