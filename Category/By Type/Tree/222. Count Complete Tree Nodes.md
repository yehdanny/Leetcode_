# Leetcode  222. Count Complete Tree Nodes

## 分類 : Tree Easy

## 題目：
Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than O(n) time complexity.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 6
Example 2:

Input: root = []
Output: 0
Example 3:

Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5 * 104].
0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 104
The tree is guaranteed to be complete.
## 演算法：
- Tree

## 程式碼：
```python
class Solution:
    def countNodes(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        count = 0
        def helper(node): #DFS
            nonlocal count
            if node :
                count += 1
            else :
                return
                
            helper(node.left) #左尋找
            helper(node.right)  #又尋找
        helper(root)
        return count
```
## Time Complexity & Space complexity:
- Time Complexity   :   Big-O(__n__)
- Space Complexity   :  Big-O(__logn__)

## 補充：
### Time Complexity :
- 所有節點跑一次 O(n)
### Space complexity :
- O(logn) 鏈狀結構O(n)
