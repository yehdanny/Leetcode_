# Leetcode  3024. Type of Triangle

## 分類 : Sorting Easy

## 題目：
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of size 3 which can form the sides of a triangle.

A triangle is called equilateral if it has all sides of equal length.
A triangle is called isosceles if it has exactly two sides of equal length.
A triangle is called scalene if all its sides are of different lengths.
Return a string representing the type of triangle that can be formed or "none" if it cannot form a triangle.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,3,3]
Output: "equilateral"
Explanation: Since all the sides are of equal length, therefore, it will form an equilateral triangle.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,4,5]
Output: "scalene"
Explanation: 
nums[0] + nums[1] = 3 + 4 = 7, which is greater than nums[2] = 5.
nums[0] + nums[2] = 3 + 5 = 8, which is greater than nums[1] = 4.
nums[1] + nums[2] = 4 + 5 = 9, which is greater than nums[0] = 3. 
Since the sum of the two sides is greater than the third side for all three cases, therefore, it can form a triangle.
As all the sides are of different lengths, it will form a scalene triangle.
 

Constraints:

nums.length == 3
1 <= nums[i] <= 100

## 演算法：
- sort

## 程式碼：
```python
class Solution:
    def triangleType(self, nums: List[int]) -> str:
        
        nums[:] = sorted(nums)  #排序
        if nums[0] + nums[1] <= nums[2]:    #定義
            return 'none'
        if len(set(nums))==1:       #equal length
            return "equilateral"
        elif len(set(nums))==2:
            return "isosceles"
        else:
            return "scalene"
```
## Time Complexity & Space complexity:
- Time Complexity   :   Big-O(__nlogn__)
- Space Complexity   :  Big-O(__1__)

## 補充：
### Time Complexity :
- sort O(nlogn)
### Space complexity :
- in place O(1)
