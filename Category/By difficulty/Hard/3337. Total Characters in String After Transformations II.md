# Leetcode  3337. Total Characters in String After Transformations II

## 分類 : DP Hard

## 題目：
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters, an integer t representing the number of transformations to perform, and an array nums of size 26. In one transformation, every character in s is replaced according to the following rules:

Replace s[i] with the next nums[s[i] - 'a'] consecutive characters in the alphabet. For example, if s[i] = 'a' and nums[0] = 3, the character 'a' transforms into the next 3 consecutive characters ahead of it, which results in "bcd".
The transformation wraps around the alphabet if it exceeds 'z'. For example, if s[i] = 'y' and nums[24] = 3, the character 'y' transforms into the next 3 consecutive characters ahead of it, which results in "zab".
Return the length of the resulting string after exactly t transformations.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcyy", t = 2, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2]

Output: 7

Explanation:

First Transformation (t = 1):

'a' becomes 'b' as nums[0] == 1
'b' becomes 'c' as nums[1] == 1
'c' becomes 'd' as nums[2] == 1
'y' becomes 'z' as nums[24] == 1
'y' becomes 'z' as nums[24] == 1
String after the first transformation: "bcdzz"
Second Transformation (t = 2):

'b' becomes 'c' as nums[1] == 1
'c' becomes 'd' as nums[2] == 1
'd' becomes 'e' as nums[3] == 1
'z' becomes 'ab' as nums[25] == 2
'z' becomes 'ab' as nums[25] == 2
String after the second transformation: "cdeabab"
Final Length of the string: The string is "cdeabab", which has 7 characters.

Example 2:

Input: s = "azbk", t = 1, nums = [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]

Output: 8

Explanation:

First Transformation (t = 1):

'a' becomes 'bc' as nums[0] == 2
'z' becomes 'ab' as nums[25] == 2
'b' becomes 'cd' as nums[1] == 2
'k' becomes 'lm' as nums[10] == 2
String after the first transformation: "bcabcdlm"
Final Length of the string: The string is "bcabcdlm", which has 8 characters.

 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists only of lowercase English letters.
1 <= t <= 109
nums.length == 26
1 <= nums[i] <= 25

## 程式碼：
```python
class Solution(object):
    def lengthAfterTransformations(self, s, t, nums):

        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        SIZE = 26

        # Step 3: Matrix multiplication
        def mat_mult(A, B):
            result = [[0] * SIZE for _ in range(SIZE)]
            for i in range(SIZE):
                for k in range(SIZE):
                    if A[i][k]:
                        for j in range(SIZE):
                            result[i][j] = (result[i][j] + A[i][k] * B[k][j]) % MOD
            return result

        # Step 4: Matrix exponentiation
        def mat_pow(matrix, power):
            result = [[int(i == j) for j in range(SIZE)] for i in range(SIZE)]
            while power:
                if power % 2:
                    result = mat_mult(result, matrix)
                matrix = mat_mult(matrix, matrix)
                power //= 2
            return result

            
        # Step 1: Count the initial occurrences of each character
        count = [0] * SIZE
        for ch in s:
            count[ord(ch) - ord('a')] += 1

        # Step 2: Build the transformation matrix
        T = [[0] * SIZE for _ in range(SIZE)]
        for i in range(SIZE):
            for step in range(1, nums[i] + 1):
                T[i][(i + step) % SIZE] += 1

        T_exp = mat_pow(T, t)

        # Step 5: Multiply count vector with T^t
        final_counts = [0] * SIZE
        for i in range(SIZE):
            for j in range(SIZE):
                final_counts[j] = (final_counts[j] + count[i] * T_exp[i][j]) % MOD

        return sum(final_counts) % MOD
```
## Time Complexity & Space complexity:
- Time Complexity   :   Big-O(__logt__)
- Space Complexity   :  Big-O(__1__)

## 補充：
### Time Complexity :
- exponentiation (each is (O(26^3))) and we do this (O(\log t)) times.
### Space complexity :
- O(1)
