# Leetcode  1931. Painting a Grid With Three Different Colors

## 分類 : OMG Hard DP

## 題目：
You are given two integers m and n. Consider an m x n grid where each cell is initially white. You can paint each cell red, green, or blue. All cells must be painted.

Return the number of ways to color the grid with no two adjacent cells having the same color. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:


Input: m = 1, n = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The three possible colorings are shown in the image above.
Example 2:


Input: m = 1, n = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The six possible colorings are shown in the image above.
Example 3:

Input: m = 5, n = 5
Output: 580986
 

Constraints:

1 <= m <= 5
1 <= n <= 1000

## 演算法：
- DP

## 程式碼：
```python
class Solution(object):
    def colorTheGrid(self, m, n):
        mod = 10**9+7
        total = 1
        for _ in range(m):
            total *= 3
        dp = [[0]*total for _ in range(n+1)]
        rowValid = [[0]*total for _ in range(total)]
        good = []
        pattern = [[] for _ in range(total)]
        for i in range(total):
            val, valid = i, 1
            for _ in range(m):
                pattern[i].append(val % 3)
                val //= 3
            for j in range(1, m):
                if pattern[i][j] == pattern[i][j-1]:
                    valid = 0
            if valid:
                good.append(i)
        for i in good:
            dp[1][i] = 1
        for i in good:
            for j in good:
                rowValid[i][j] = 1
                for k in range(m):
                    if pattern[i][k] == pattern[j][k]:
                        rowValid[i][j] = 0
        for col in range(2, n+1):
            for i in good:
                total_ways = 0
                for j in good:
                    if rowValid[i][j]:
                        total_ways += dp[col-1][j]
                dp[col][i] = total_ways % mod
        return sum(dp[n]) % mod
